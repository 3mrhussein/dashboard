# Project Overview
This project is a demo dashboard built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), designed to be mobile responsive and user-friendly. The dashboard includes various types of charts created with [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/), a powerful suite of React components. In addition, the project uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for client-side routing, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, and [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/) for icons.

The dashboard features a kanban board, text editor, and color picker. It was built as a personal portfolio project to showcase my skills and is intended to be used as a reference for future projects.
